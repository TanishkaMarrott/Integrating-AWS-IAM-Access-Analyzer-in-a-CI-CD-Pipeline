# Enhancing CI/CD Workflows: Integrating AWS IAM Access Analyzer for Improved Security

This project revolves around the idea - **_Security + Automation_**  

We aim to elevate both efficiency and security within deployment processes by integrating a specialized tool, `cfn-policy-validator` , into a cohesive CI/CD Pipeline. This integration _**automates IAM Policy Validation Tests**_, ensuring **_IAM security is inherently a part of every deployment cycle_**, while automatically halting the build, in the event of its failure.  

---> Robust Security & Compliance throughout the Infrastructure


## Access Analyzer - Quick Walkthrough

- Helps identify resources exposed to the public internet
- Cross-Account Resource Access
- Unused Access Control Policies ( This might lead to unintentional Privilege Escalation )
- Automated Policy Generation through AWS CloudTrail Logs
- Policy Validation against IAM Best Practices - ( Stringent Policy Checks for a compliant architecture )
